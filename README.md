## Overview

**SSM-CGM** is a neural **state-space model** for **interpretable glucose forecasting** and **counterfactual analysis** using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and wearable sensor data.

It integrates CGM with physiological signals such as **heart rate, respiration, stress, etc.** to:
- Improve short-term glucose forecasting over transformer-based baselines  
- Provide interpretable variable and temporal importance  
- Simulate counterfactual forecasts (e.g., “what if heart rate increases?”)

---

## Key Features

- **Mamba-based state-space core** efficient long-context forecasting  
- **Variable Selection Networks (VSNs)** feature-level interpretability  
- **Hidden Attention maps** identify influential time windows  
- **Counterfactual simulation** using sequential g-formula framework  
- **Benchmarking** against Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)

## Quick Start


**Environment setup**
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ssmcgm
```

**Run example**
```bash
python SSM_CGM.py
```

Or explore the Jupyter notebooks and python scripts under:
- `Benchmarking/` for forecasting  
- `Counterfactuals/Notebook/` for counterfactual simulations  
- `Interpretability/` for model attributions  

---

## Dataset Summary

- **AI-READI:** 741 participants with 8–10 days of CGM and wearable data (5-min intervals)  
- **CGMacros:** 45 participants with CGM and annotated meals (used for meal detection training)

<!-- ---

## Notes

- Counterfactual forecasts are *associational*, not causal.  
- AI-READI lacks meal and medication annotations (meals are inferred).
